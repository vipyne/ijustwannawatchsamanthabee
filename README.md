# I just wanna watch Samantha Bee

### motivation
I just wanted to be able to click one button and watch a Samanthe Bee
episode while making dinner.

### the code
Lots of TODOs.  Brittle in places. a little clunky.  TBS doesn't serve
it's content over HTTPS.

### the extension
`I just wanna watch Samantha Bee` can be found on the Chrome extension store [here](wwwblahblahblah).

Click on the icon to open a new browser tab that plays the latest full episode of `Full
Frontal with Samantha Bee`.

If the browser is open to any Samantha Bee archive page, clicking on the
chrome extension icon will play that episode.
